      Race is the largest free hot-air  ballooning event in the world. During three
      days in early September, you can  look up into the Reno skies and see a rainbow
      of hot air balloons soaring  about. From its humble beginnings in 1982 with
      just 20 balloons, The Great Reno  Balloon Race has taken flight with up to 100
      balloons each year. The idea was  to create an event that would keep visitors
      in town the weekend between the  State Fair and the Reno Air Races and 35 years
      later, it is known as a world-renowned,  and locally, a beloved community tradition.</p><h4><strong>September  14-18,

      pilots and crews. In the  past ten years, the event has attracted more than
      150,000 spectators. The event  features six racing classes, a large display
      of static aircraft and several  military and civil flight demonstrations.</p>'

    - Venice, Italy
    - venice-italy
    - 
    - One of the world's most beautiful cities also happens to be one of its most
      unusual. Venice is actually spread over 120 islands in the Adriatic Sea. Because
      the city is connected by canals instead of streets, a good way to see Venice
      is on a romantic gondola ride. The epicenter of the city is St.Mark's Square,
      where you'll find the 900- year-old St. Mark's Basilica.

      with a password request and you’re given a pin to recognize you as an honored
      guest. You’re then escorted through a back door into the club. The club is dimly
      lit, with drinks served “prohibition style” in tea cups, you know, just in case
      the party gets busted, you’re just drinking tea! Over the course of the evening,
      a band plays, guests are invited to dance, pictures are taken with the flapper
      girls, a horse race complete with gambling takes place, and a little skit is
      performed pretending to be worried about a bust. Most people get dressed up
      as best they can to look like they’re dressed for the era. The costumes add
